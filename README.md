# html-portfolio
This is my personal portfolio website, created entirely with HTML. It includes an About Me section, showcases sample projects like a Birthday Invite page and an Anime Ranking page, and lists my contact info. The main goal was to practice building and structuring a website before moving on to CSS and JavaScript.
