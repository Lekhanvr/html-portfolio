<h1>About Me</h1>

  Hi, my name is Lekhan, a dedicated learner with a strong interest in web development 
  and emerging technologies. I value discipline, continuous growth, and strive to combine 
  technical knowledge with creativity. My goal is to develop projects that are both 
  functional and impactful.

  Beyond academics and coding, I am curious about how technology can solve real-world 
  problems. I aim to contribute to projects that encourage creativity, innovation, 
  and positive change.

  In my free time, I enjoy staying active through sports and regular workouts at the gym. 
  These activities keep me disciplined, energetic, and motivated, helping me maintain 
  a healthy balance between work and personal life.
